Have you ever imagined that you're (for example) the leader of a colony mission to a far-away habitable planet (let's call it Sich), and it's your job to write a constitution for the new society there? Where would you start? How would you go about making decisions? Are there any factors about the planet or colonists that might influence those decisions?

In many ways, this problem is easy compared to the challenge of improving our existing democratic institutions, which are tethered by inertial forces like systemic racism and constrained to operate in a world of many other nations, some of which would destroy you if they could. And yet, even on Sich, it's hard to know where to start.

As a mathematician, I like to address problems like these with the language of *optimization *functions. What quantity should we design the Constitution of Sich to maximize? Fairness? Opportunity? The chances our colony survives at all? And how exactly do we go about defining that quantity? And then solving this optimization problem? And of course, can we use any of this to reccommend practical changes for our real democracies?

I'm still learning a lot about how we can use math and science to answer these types of questions, but I know that no one has all the answers. So come on this ride with me to learn what we can!

PS: I expect a lot of my posts will be about very specific questions, but I aspire to always relate back to this big question, and hopefully have some posts about this more general question where I can.
